The `readnext` package provides a hybrid recommender system for computer science papers.

It is part of my master's thesis at the University of GÃ¶ttingen supervised by [Corinna Breitinger](https://gipplab.org/team/corinna-breitinger/) and [Terry Ruas](https://gipplab.org/team/dr-terry-lima-ruas/).

The project is under active development.
A comprehensive Readme with the theoretical background, a detailed explanation of the repository structure as well as installation instructions will follow soon ðŸ¥³
