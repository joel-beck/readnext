The `readnext` package provides a hybrid recommender system for computer science papers.
Its main objective is to suggest relevant research papers based on a given query document you might be currently exploring, streamlining your journey to discover more intriguing academic literature.

It is part of my master's thesis at the University of GÃ¶ttingen supervised by [Corinna Breitinger](https://gipplab.org/team/corinna-breitinger/) and [Terry Ruas](https://gipplab.org/team/dr-terry-lima-ruas/).

The project is under active development.
Below you find the installation instructions and a brief overview of the package.
Check out the [documentation](https://joel-beck.github.io/readnext/) for background information about the citation-based methods and language models that are used in this project as well as details how to reproduce all results and customize the package to your individual needs.

## Quick Look

```python
from readnext import readnext, LanguageModelChoice, FeatureWeights

result = readnext(
    # `Attention is all you need` query paper
    arxiv_url="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762",
    language_model_choice=LanguageModelChoice.FASTTEXT,
    feature_weights=FeatureWeights(
        publication_date=1,
        citationcount_document=2,
        citationcount_author=0.5,
        co_citation_analysis=2,
        bibliographic_coupling=2,
    ),
)

print(result.recommendations.language_to_citation.head(10))
```

## Installation

Currently, the `readnext` package is not available on PyPI but can be installed directly from GitHub.

This project requires Python 3.10.
Earlier versions of Python are not supported.
Future support for higher versions will be available once the `torch` and `transformers` libraries are fully compatible with Python 3.11 and beyond.

Note: The project has recently been migrated from Pandas to Polars for massive performance improvements.
Thus, it is currently recommended to install the package from the `polars` branch.
Once all unit tests have been updated and changes have been merged into the `main` branch, the installation instructions will be updated accordingly.

```bash
# via HTTPS
pip install git+https://github.com/joel-beck/readnext.git@polars#egg=readnext

# via SSH
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/joel-beck/readnext.git@polars#egg=readnext
```

## Overview

The following diagram presents a high-level overview of the hybrid recommender system for papers in the training corpus:

![Hybrid recommender system schematic](./docs/assets/hybrid-architecture.png)

The hybrid structure involves a **Citation Recommender** that combines global document features and citation-based features, and a **Language Recommender** that generates embeddings from paper abstracts.

The hybrid recommender combines the Citation Recommender and the Language Recommender in a *cascade* fashion, i.e. one is used to generate a candidate list which is then re-ranked by the second recommender.

Both component orders as well as the two candidate lists are evaluated.The objectives of the evaluation study are

1. To determine the best component order for the cascade strategy, i.e. Citation -> Language or Language -> Citation.
1. To investigate if the hybrid approach improves performance over single component recommenders in the first place.



### Citation Recommender

The **Citation Recommender** extracts five features from each training document out of two categories: global document features and citation-based features.

**Global Document Features**

These features are derived from the document metadata in the D3 dataset.

- **Publication Date**:
    A *novelty* metric. Recent publications score higher, as they build upon earlier papers and compare their findings with existing results.

- **Paper Citation Count**:
    A *document popularity* metric. Papers with more citations are considered more valuable and relevant.

- **Author Citation Count**:
    An *author popularity* metric. Authors with higher total citations across their publications are deemed more important in the research community.

Note that global document features are identical for each query document.


**Citation-Based Features**

These features are obtained from the citation data retrieved from the Semantic Scholar API and are *pairwise features* computed for each pair of documents in the training corpus.

- **Co-Citation Analysis**:
    Counts the number of shared *citing* papers, i.e. papers that themselves cite both the query and the candidate paper. Candidate documents with higher co-citation analysis scores are considered more relevant to the query document.

- **Bibliographic Coupling**:
    Counts shared *cited* papers, i.e. papers that are cited by both the query and the candidate paper. Candidate documents with higher bibliographic coupling scores are considered more relevant to the query document.


**Feature Weighting**

The five features are weighted in the following manner:

- To reduce memory load, only the top-100 of all precomputed scores are stored for each feature and query document. This number is configurable before running the setup scripts through the `readnext/config.py` file.

- All training documents are then ranked by each feature individually in ascending order. The candidate paper with the best score for a given feature is assigned rank 1 for this feature, the candidate paper with the 100th best score is assigned rank 100, all worse-scoring papers are assigned rank 101.

- Thus, the weighting scheme grows linearly with a threshold at rank 100. The absolute magnitude of the original scores is not considered, but only their ranks to diminish the impact of outliers.

- Instead of using the ranks directly for feature weighting, points are computed for better interpretability. They behave like inverse ranks, i.e. the best-scoring paper for a given feature receives 100 points, the 100th best-scoring paper receives 1 point, and all worse-scoring papers receive 0 points.

- The points for each feature are combined linearly with the user-specified feature weights. Papers with the highest weighted points score are recommended.


### Language Recommender

Note: The following section assumes basic familiarity with embeddings and language models in general.
For a more thorough introduction, check out the [documentation](https://joel-beck.github.io/readnext/background/#language-models).

The **Language Recommender** encodes paper abstracts into embedding vectors to capture semantic meaning. Papers with embeddings most similar to the query document (measured by cosine similarity) are recommended.

8 language models across 3 categories are considered: keyword-based models, static embedding models, and contextual embedding models.


**Keyword-based models**

They produce sparse vector embeddings where the embedding dimension equals the vocabulary size of all document abstracts in the training corpus.
For these models, text preprocessing and tokenization is performed by the `spaCy` library using the `en_core_web_sm` model.

The following keyword-based models are considered:

- TF-IDF: Implemented according to the formula:

    $$\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \text{TF}(t, d) \cdot \text{IDF}(t)$$

    with:

    $$\text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{\text{count}(t, d)}{\text{len}(d)}$$

    and:

    $$\text{IDF}(t) = \log\left(\frac{1 + N}{1 + \text{DF}(t)} + 1\right)$$

    where:

    - $t$ is a token,
    - $d$ is a document,
    - $\text{TF}(t, d)$ is the term frequency of token $t$ in document $d$ (interpreted as the relative frequency of a term in a document),
    - $\text{IDF}(t)$ is the inverse document frequency of token $t$ across all documents in the training corpus,
    - $\text{count}(t, d)$ is the count of token $t$ in document $d$,
    - $\text{len}(d)$ is the total number of tokens in document $d$,
    - $\text{DF}(t)$ is the document frequency of token $t$ (the number of documents in the corpus that contain the term $t$),
    - $N$ is the total number of documents in the corpus.

- BM25: Implemented in the BM25+ variant as proposed by (Lv & Zhai, 2011) and described in (Trotman et al., 2014).

    The formula is:

    $$\text{BM25}(t, d) = \text{BM25-TF}(t, d) \cdot \text{BM25-IDF}(t)$$

    with:

    $$\text{BM25-TF}(t, d) = \frac{(k + 1) \cdot \text{TF}(t, d)}{k \cdot (1 - b + b \cdot (\text{len}(d) / \text{avgdl})) + \text{TF}(t, d)} + \delta$$

    and:

    $$\text{BM25-IDF}(t) = \log\left(\frac{N+1}{\text{DF}(t)}\right)$$

    where:

    - $t$ is a token,
    - $d$ is a document,
    - $\text{BM25-TF}(t, d)$ is the BM25+ term frequency of token $t$ in document $d$,
    - $\text{BM25-IDF}(t)$ is the BM25+ inverse document frequency of token $t$ across all documents in the training corpus,
    - $\text{TF}(t, d)$ is the term frequency of token $t$ in document $d$ (interpreted as the relative frequency of a term in a document),
    - $\text{DF}(t)$ is the document frequency of token $t$ (the number of documents in the corpus that contain the term $t$),
    - $\text{len}(d)$ is the total number of tokens in document $d$,
    - $\text{avgdl}$ is the average document length across the corpus,
    - $N$ is the total number of documents in the corpus,
    - $k$, $b$, and $\delta$ are free parameters.

    Default values of $k = 1.5$, $b = 0.75$, and $\delta = 1.0$ are adapted from the [rank_bm25 package](https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25/blob/990470ebbe6b28c18216fd1a8b18fe7446237dd6/rank_bm25.py#L176).


**Static embedding models**

They produce dense vector embeddings where the embedding dimension is fixed (here set to the default of 300) and independent of the vocabulary size.
Word embeddings are averaged dimension-wise to obtain a single embedding vector for each abstract.
Again, `spaCy` is used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
All three static embedding models are pretrained and implemented via their `gensim` interface:

- Word2Vec: Pretrained on the Google News corpus using the `word2vec-google-news-300` gensim model.
- GloVe: Pretrained on the Gigaword corpus and Wikipedia using the `glove.6B.300d` model from the NLP Stanford GloVe project.
- FastText: Pretrained on the Common Crawl corpus and Wikipedia using the `cc.en.300.bin` model from the FastText Website.


**Contextual embedding models**

Similar to static embedding models, they produce dense vector embeddings where the embedding dimension is fixed (here set to the default of 768) and independent of the vocabulary size.
Instead of string tokens, contextual embedding models take integer token IDs as input which are mapped to words and subwords and learned during pretraining.
All three static embedding models are pretrained and implemented via the HuggingFace `transformers` library:

- BERT: Pretrained on the BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia using the `bert-base-uncased` model.
- SciBERT: Pretrained on the Semantic Scholar corpus (i.e. specific to scientific language) using the `allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased` model.
- Longformer: Pretrained on the BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia using the `allenai/longformer-base-4096` model.

Instead of averaging word embeddings like static embedding models, these Transformer based models cut off the document abstracts at a maximum token length of 512 for BERT and SciBERT and 4096 for the Longformer model.
However, only 0.58% of all abstracts in the training corpus exceed the maximum token length of 512 such that the impact of this cutoff is negligible.



### Evaluation Metrics

The **Mean Average Precision (MAP)** is used as evaluation metric due to the following reasons:

1. It takes the order of recommendations into account, i.e. it is not only important to recommend relevant items but also to recommend them early in the list.
1. All items on the recommendation list are considered, i.e. it is not only important to recommend relevant items but also to avoid irrelevant items.
1. It works well with binary 0/1 encoded labels as in our case for irrelevant/relevant recommendations.

The **Average Precision (AP)** computes a scalar score for a single recommendation list according to the following definitions:

**Precision**

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{\# of relevant items}}{\text{\# of items}}$$


**Average Precision (AP)**

$$\text{AP} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{k=1}^{K} P(k) \cdot \text{rel}(k)$$

where:

- $K$ is the total number of items,
- $r$ is the total number of relevant items,
- $P(k)$ is the precision at $k$,
- $\text{rel}(k)$ is 1 if item $k$ is relevant and 0 otherwise.

If the labels are binary 0/1 encoded as in our case, the formula simplifies to:

$$\text{AP} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \text{rel}(i)}{k}$$


The Mean Average Precision is then computed as the average over the Average Precision scores for the recommendations of all query documents in the training corpus.

**Mean Average Precision (MAP)**

$$\text{MAP} = \frac{1}{Q} \sum_{q=1}^{Q} \text{AP}(q)$$

where:

- $Q$ is the total number of query documents,
- $\text{AP}(q)$ is the average precision for query document $q$.

Within this project, the MAP computes a scalar score for a given combination of Language Model Choice and Feature Weights.
Thus, to determine which Recommender order works best within the Hybrid structure, we could e.g. aggregate the MAP scores for each order over all Language Model Choices and Feature Weights.




## Setup

### Data and Models

To execute all scripts and reproduce project results, the following **local downloads** are necessary:

- [D3 papers and authors dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/7071698#.ZFZnCi9ByLc)
- [Arxiv dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv)
- Pretrained [word2vec-google-news-300 Word2Vec model](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data) from Gensim
- Pretrained [glove.6B GloVe model](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) from the Stanford NLP website
- Pretrained [English FastText model](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html#models) from the FastText website


1. **D3 Dataset**

    The hybrid recommender system's training data originates from multiple sources.
    The [D3 DBLP Discovery Dataset](https://github.com/jpwahle/lrec22-d3-dataset/tree/main) serves as the foundation, offering information about computer science papers and their authors.
    This dataset provides global document features for the text-independent recommender as well as paper abstracts for the content-based recommender.


2. **Citation Information**

    The D3 dataset only includes total citation and reference counts for each paper.
    To obtain individual citations and references, the [Semantic Scholar API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/graph) is employed.
    A [private API key](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key) is recommended for a higher request rate.


3. **Arxiv Labels**

    Arxiv categories act as labels for the recommender system.
    If two papers share at least one arxiv label, the recommendation is considered relevant, and irrelevant otherwise.
    Arxiv labels are extracted from the [arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) dataset on Kaggle.


### Environment Variables

`readnext` needs to know the locations of local data and model files in your file system, which can be stored in any directory.
User-specific information is provided through environment variables.
The `.env_template` file in the project root directory contains a template for the expected environment variables with default values (except for the Semantic Scholar API key):

```bash
# .env_template
DOCUMENTS_METADATA_FILENAME="2022-11-30_papers.jsonl"
AUTHORS_METADATA_FILENAME="2022-11-30_authors.jsonl"
ARXIV_METADATA_FILENAME="arxiv_metadata.json"

SEMANTICSCHOLAR_API_KEY="ABC123"

DATA_DIRPATH="data"
MODELS_DIRPATH="models"
RESULTS_DIRPATH="results"
```

Explanation of the environment variables:

-  `DOCUMENTS_METADATA_FILENAME` and `AUTHORS_METADATA_FILENAME` correspond to the downloaded D3 dataset files, `ARXIV_METADATA_FILENAME` to the downloaded arxiv dataset file.
-  `SEMANTICSCHOLAR_API_KEY` represents the API key for the Semantic Scholar API.
-  `DATA_DIRPATH` is the directory path for all local data files, including downloaded and generated data files.
-  `MODELS_DIRPATH` is the directory path for all pretrained model files.
-  `RESULTS_DIRPATH` is the directory path for all stored result files, such as tokenized abstracts, numeric embeddings of abstracts, and precomputed co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and cosine similarity scores.


### Setup Scripts

The inference step of the `readnext` package leverages preprocessed and precomputed data such that all recommender features and abstract embeddings are readily available.
To generate these files locally, run the following setup scripts in the specified order.
All scripts are located in the `readnext/scripts` directory.


1. **Dataset Construction**

    These scripts are located in the `readnext/scripts/data` directory.

    1. `s1_read_raw_data.py`: Reads documents, authors and arxiv metadata from raw JSON files and write it out into Parquet format.
    1. `s2_merge_arxiv_labels.py`: Merges the arxiv metadata with the D3 dataset via the arxiv id. Adds arxiv labels as new feature to the dataset which are later used as ground-truth labels for the recommender system.
    1. `s3_merge_authors.py`: Adds the author citationcount to the dataset and selects the most popular author for each document.
    1. `s4_add_citations.py`: Sends requests to the semanticscholar API to obtain citation and reference urls for all documents in the dataset and add them as features to the dataframe.
    1. `s5_add_ranks.py`: Adds rank features for global document characteristics (publication date, document citation count and author citation count) to the dataset and selects a subset of the most cited documents for the final dataset.


All further script paths are relative to the `readnext/scripts/modeling` directory.


2. **Citation Models**

    1. `run_co_citation_analysis.py`: Precomputes co-citation analysis scores for all document pairs in the dataset.
    1. `bibliographic_coupling.py`: Precomputes bibliographic coupling scores for all document pairs in the dataset.


3. **Language Models**

    1. `tokenizer/run_tokenizer.py`: Tokenizes the abstracts of all documents in the dataset by four different tokenizers into the appropriate format for all eight language models.
    1. `embedder/run_embedder_*.py`: These scripts generate sparse or dense numeric embeddings of all document abstracts for each language model. The process is split into separate scripts for each model to allow for easy parallelization.
    1. `cosine_similarities/run_cosine_similarities_*.py`: Precomputes cosine similarity scores for all document pairs in the dataset for each language model. Again, multiple scripts are used for parallelization purposes.


## Usage

The user interface for generating recommendations is designed to be simple and easy to use.
It relies on the top-level `readnext()` function, which takes two required and one optional keyword argument:

- An identifier for the query paper.
This can be the Semanticscholar ID, Semanticscholar URL, Arxiv ID, or Arxiv URL of the paper.
This argument is required and should be provided as a string.

    **Term Definition**:

    - The *Semanticscholar ID* is a 40-digit hexadecimal string at the end of the Semanticscholar URL after the last forward slash.
    For example, the Semanticscholar ID for the URL `https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67c4ffa7f9c25e9e0f0b0eac5619070f6a5d143d` is `67c4ffa7f9c25e9e0f0b0eac5619070f6a5d143d`.
    - The *Arxiv ID* is a 4-digit number followed by a dot followed by a 5-digit number at the end of the Arxiv URL after the last forward slash.
    For example, the Arxiv ID for the URL `https://arxiv.org/abs/1234.56789` is `1234.56789`.

- The language model choice for the Language Recommender, which is used to tokenize and embed the query paper's abstract.
This argument is required and should be passed using the `LanguageModelChoice` Enum, which provides autocompletion for all eight available language models.

- The feature weighting for the Citation Recommender.
This argument is optional and is submitted using an instance of the `FeatureWeights` class.
If not specified, the five features (`publication_date`, `citationcount_document`, `citationcount_author`, `co_citation_analysis`, and `bibliographic_coupling`) are given equal weights of one.
Note that the weights are normalized to sum up to one, so the absolute values are irrelevant; only the relative ratios matter.


### Examples

Inference works for both 'seen' and 'unseen' query documents, depending on whether the query document is part of the training corpus or not.


**Seen Query Paper**

If the query paper is part of the training corpus, all feature values are precomputed and inference is fast.

In the [Quick Look](#quick-look) example at the beginning, we have already obtained recommendations for the query paper "Attention is all you need" by Vaswani et al. (2017) using the `FastText` language model and custom feature weights.

Assuming we have read the top recommendation "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" by Yoshua Bengio, we can continue our reading flow by extracting the identifier for the previously recommended paper from the `semantischolar_url` or `arxiv_url` columns of the previous output.
In this case, we use the `SciBERT` language model and the default feature weights of 1 for each feature:

```python
from readnext import readnext, LanguageModelChoice, FeatureWeights

result = readnext(
    # `Attention is all you need` query paper
    arxiv_url="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762",
    language_model_choice=LanguageModelChoice.FASTTEXT,
    feature_weights=FeatureWeights(
        publication_date=1,
        citationcount_document=2,
        citationcount_author=0.5,
        co_citation_analysis=2,
        bibliographic_coupling=2,
    ),
)

# extract one of the paper identifiers from the previous top recommendation
semanticscholar_url = result.recommendations.citation_to_language[0, "semanticscholar_url"]

result_seen_query = readnext(
    semanticscholar_url=semanticscholar_url,
    language_model_choice=LanguageModelChoice.SCIBERT,
)
```

A message is printed to the console indicating that the query paper is part of the training corpus:

```console
> â­âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ®
> â                                                  â
> â Query document is contained in the training data â
> â                                                  â
> â°âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ¯
```

The return value of the `readnext()` function contains the following attributes:

- `document_identifier`: Contains the identifiers of the query paper.

- `document_info`: Provides information about the query paper.

- `features`: Individual dataframes that include values for `publication_date`, `citationcount_document`, `citationcount_author`, `co_citation_analysis`, `bibliographic_coupling`, `cosine_similarity`, and `feature_weights`.

- `ranks`: Individual dataframes that list the ranks of individual features.

- `points`: Individual dataframes that specify the points of individual features.

- `labels`: Individual dataframes that present the arxiv labels for all candidate papers and binary 0/1 labels related to the query paper.
These binary labels are useful for 'seen' query papers where the arxiv labels of the query paper is known.
For 'unseen' papers this information is not availabels and all binary labels are set to 0.

- `recommendations`: Individual dataframes that offer the top paper recommendations.
Recommendations are calculated for both Hybrid-Recommender orders (Citation -> Language and Language -> Citation) and both the intermediate candidate lists and the final hybrid recommendations.

Let's first take a look at our new query paper:

```python
print(result_seen_query.document_info)
```

```console
> Document 11212020
> ---------------------
> Title: Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate
> Author: Yoshua Bengio
> Publication Date: 2014-09-01
> Arxiv Labels: ['cs.CL', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']
> Semanticscholar URL: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa72afa9b2cbc8f0d7b05d52548906610ffbb9c5
> Arxiv URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473
```

Now we want to get recommendations for which papers we should read next.
Here, we choose the recommendations for the Citation -> Language Hybrid-Recommender order.

The output is a dataframe where each row represents a recommendation.
The rows are sorted in descending order by the cosine similarity between the query paper and the candidate papers since the re-ranking step is performed by the Language Recommender.

For brevity we limit the output to the top three recommendations:


```python
print(result_seen_query.recommendations.citation_to_language.head(3))
```

| candidate_d3_document_id | cosine_similarity | title                                                                                         | author                 | publication_date | arxiv_labels                        | integer_label | semanticscholar_url                                                            | arxiv_url                        |

Hence, we might read the paper "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Ilya Sutskever et al. next.

If you are interested in the additional Citation Recommender feature values that were used to generate the candidate list, you can access them via the `recommendations.citation_to_language_candidates` attribute of the `result_seen_query` object.


**Unseen Query Paper**

If the query paper is not part of the training corpus, the inference step takes longer since tokenization, embedding and the computation of co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling and cosine similarity scores has to be performed from scratch.

However, apart from a longer waiting time, **the user does not have to care about** if the query paper is part of the training corpus or not since the user interface remains the same!

As an example, we fetch recommendations for the "GPT-4 Technical Report" paper by OpenAI. This paper is too recent to be part of the training corpus.

Due to its recency, it might not have been cited that often, so we lower the weight of the `co_citation_analysis` feature. Further, we increase the `publication_date` weight and decrease the `citationcount_author` weight.
For the Language Recommender we use the `GloVe` model to embed the paper abstract.

Note that we only need to specify the weights for the features we want to change from the default value of 1

```python
from readnext import readnext, LanguageModelChoice, FeatureWeights

result_unseen_query = readnext(
    arxiv_url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774",
    language_model_choice=LanguageModelChoice.GLOVE,
    feature_weights=FeatureWeights(
        publication_date=4,
        citationcount_author=0.2,
        co_citation_analysis=0.2,
    ),
)
```

The console output informs us that the query paper is not part of the training corpus and provides some progress updates for the ongoing computations:

```console
> â­âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ®

> â                                                      â

> Loading training corpus................. â (0.07 seconds)

> Embedding query abstract................ â (0.00 seconds)
> Loading pretrained embeddings........... â (0.19 seconds)
> Computing cosine similarities........... â (0.05 seconds)
```

The time distribution differs between the language models. For `GloVe`, loading the large pretrained model into memory allocates by far the most time.

Now, we generate the recommendations candidate list with the Language Recommender and re-rank the candidates with the Citation Recommender.
Since the second recommender of the hybrid structure is the Citation Recommender, the output is sorted by the weighted points score of the individual features:

```python
print(result_unseen_query.recommendations.language_to_citation.head(3))
```

The top recommendation introducing the PaLM language model as a competitor to the GPT family seems quite reasonable.

Note that the `integer_label` column is not informative for unseen query papers and only kept for consistency.
Since no arxiv labels are available for unseen query papers they can not intersect with the arxiv labels of the candidates such that all values of the `integer_label` column are set to 0.


If you are interested in the cosine similarity values that were used to generate the candidate list, you can access them via the `recommendations.language_to_citation_candidates` attribute of the `result_unseen_query` object.


### Input Validation

The `pydantic` library is used for basic input validation.
For invalid user inputs the command fails early before any computations are performed with an informative error message.

The following checks are performed:

- The Semanticscholar ID must be a 40-character hexadecimal string.

- The Semanticscholar URL must be a valid URL starting with `https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/`.

- The Arxiv ID must start with 4 digits followed by a dot followed by 5 more
digits (e.g. `1234.56789`).

- The Arxiv URL must be a valid URL starting with `https://arxiv.org/abs/`.

- At least one of the four query paper identifiers must be provided.

- The feature weights must be non-negative numeric values.


For example, the following command fails because we assigned a negative weight to the `publication_date` feature:

```python
from readnext import readnext, LanguageModelChoice, FeatureWeights

result = readnext(
    arxiv_id="2101.03041",
    language_model_choice=LanguageModelChoice.BM25,
    feature_weights=FeatureWeights(publication_date=-1),
)
```

```console
pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for FeatureWeights
publication_date
  ensure this value is greater than or equal to 0 (type=value_error.number.not_ge; limit_value=0)
```
