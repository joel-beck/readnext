!!! note

    This section is intended to instruct users on how to adapt and customize the package to align with their specific needs.
    It covers topics such as extending the features of the Citation Recommender, incorporating individual language models into the Language Model Recommender, or employing different metrics for evaluation.

    For a better understanding of the recommendation pipeline and to identify potential areas for customization to suit your research needs, we suggest reviewing the [Overview](overview.md) and the [Background](background.md) sections.
