Welcome to the `readnext` documentation! ☀️

The `readnext` package provides a hybrid recommender system for computer science papers.
Its main objective is to suggest relevant research papers based on a given query document you might be currently exploring, streamlining your journey to discover more intriguing academic literature.

Here, you'll find everything you need to know about the project's background, as well as step-by-step instructions on how to install, use the package for your own needs, and reproduce the results of my thesis:

- [Installation](installation.md): Get started with the package in no time with a simple installation guide.

- [Overview](overview.md): Get a high-level perspective of the project with a concise schematic overview.

- [Setup](setup.md): Build the foundation of inference by downloading the required data and model files. Set environment variables, run user scripts to precompute values for a fast inference step and get tips for an efficient development workflow.

- [Background](background.md): Dive into the details of the citation-based methods and language models utilized in this project, and learn how they can help quantify document similarity.

- [Inference](inference.md): Instructions on how to employ the package for inference, enabling you to extract recommendations for any query document.

- [Reproducibility](reproducibility.md): A comprehensive guide to ensure the results presented in the thesis can be reproduced and validated with precision and ease.

- [Customization](customization.md): Detailed guidance on tailoring the package to your needs, including how to extend features, incorporate individual language models, and utilize diverse metrics for evaluation.
