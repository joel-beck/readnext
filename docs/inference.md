# Inference

!!! note

    This section is dedicated to guiding you on how to utilize the package for inference, or in simpler terms, how to derive recommendations based on a given query document.
    For documents available during the training phase, inference is straightforward and involves a simple lookup.
    For unseen documents, the process is more complex, requiring the computation of features, embeddings and scores from scratch.

    As we work on expanding this section, we recommend visiting the [Overview](overview.md) section.
    It provides a holistic understanding of the package's operation and offers a brief introduction to the inference process.
