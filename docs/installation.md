# Installation

Currently, the `readnext` package is not available on PyPI but can be installed directly from GitHub.

This project requires Python 3.10.
Earlier versions of Python are not supported.
Future support for higher versions will be available once the `torch` and `transformers` libraries are fully compatible with Python 3.11 and beyond.
