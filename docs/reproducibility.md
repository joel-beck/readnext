# Reproducibility

!!! note

    We're in the process of creating a detailed guide to demonstrate how to reproduce the results outlined in the thesis.
    This guide will be available as soon as the package achieves its first stable release, ensuring its readiness for widespread use.

    Meanwhile, you are encouraged to examine the [source code](https://github.com/joel-beck/readnext) and delve into the [Background](background.md) section.
    The latter provides a comprehensive explanation of the foundational concepts and methods employed in this package.
